# ðŸ§  LangChain + HuggingFace + FAISS: Document-Based Q&A System

Welcome to a beginner-friendly yet powerful **Document Question Answering (QA)** system!  
This project demonstrates how you can build your own LLM-powered assistant that answers questions from **custom uploaded documents** â€” using **LangChain**, **HuggingFace**, and **FAISS**.

> ðŸ’¬ **Ask Questions. Get Answers. From Your Own Documents.**

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

- âœ… Upload `.txt` files and convert them into searchable knowledge chunks
- âœ… Use **HuggingFace Transformers** for generating semantic embeddings
- âœ… Store document vectors using **FAISS** for fast retrieval
- âœ… Ask natural language questions and get **contextual answers** using the **Mistral 7B LLM**

Though not overly complex, this project is a **great starting point** to understand:
- Prompt engineering
- Embedding-based retrieval (RAG)
- Local vector databases
- HuggingFace model integration
